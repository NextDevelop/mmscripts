This is a collection of scripts that I've created or gathered to make it easier to create assets for iOS and Android designs.

Most of the files stored under Applications are AppleScripts that were created by me for use at Mutual Mobile. I'm opening up their code so that others can use them in the future. The rights to the AppleScripts fall under the MIT license.

Most of the .jsx files under Adobe Scripts have been compiled from various people on ps-scripts.com and other sources. The rights to those belong to the original creator.

I recommend using FastScripts http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/ to run them.

Contact me at mmscripts@seandellis.com if you have any questions or issues.
